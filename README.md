## KNX Explanation ##

[<img src="https://www.knx.org/wGlobal/wGlobal/layout/images/knx-logo.png" />](https://www.knx.org/knx-en/knx/association/what-is-knx/index.php)

The [KNX IP Protocol](https://www.knx.org/knx-en/knx/association/what-is-knx/index.php) is an _international open standard_ for smart homes and smart buildings automation. It is a decentralized system. Each device can talk directly to each other without the need of a central controller or server. Any panel or server is just for telesupervision and for sending requests. KNX IP Protocol uses a UDP multicast on _224.0.23.12 : 3671_, so there is no need for a KNX Router unless you want to communicate to KNX Devices that are not in the WIFI Network (Twisted Pair, RF, Powerline).

Each device has a physical address (like a fixed IP) as **1 . 1 . 0** and that address is used for configuration purposes.

Each device can be configured with group addresses as **2 / 2 / 1** and that address can be used for sending/receiving commands.
So, for example, if 2 devices that are configured with the **2 / 2 / 1** for turning on/off their outputs, and other device send _Turn ON_ command to **2 / 2 / 1**, both devices will turn on their outputs.

## Integration ##

Several home automation systems have KNX support. For example, [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant) has a [XKNX Python Library](https://github.com/XKNX/xknx) to connect to KNX devices using a KNX Router. If you don't have a **KNX Router**, you can use a **Software KNX Router** like [KNXd](https://github.com/knxd/knxd) on the same Raspberry Pi than Home Assistant. KNXd is used by Home Assistant for reading this UDP Multicast, although KNXd has other cool features that need extra hardware like connect to KNX devices by Twister Pair, Power Line or RF.

If using the Home Assistant distribution called **Hassio**, everything for KNX is already included by default.

If you use the ETS (KNX Configurator Software) you can add any Tasmota KNX as a dummy device.

## Requirements ##

All the libraries required for Tasmota are [here](https://github.com/ascillato/Tasmota_KNX/tree/development/lib) along with the extra required for the KNX Driver:

* [ESP KNX IP Library](https://github.com/ascillato/Tasmota_KNX/tree/development/lib/esp-knx-ip-0.5.2). A copy of this modified library is also available [here](https://github.com/ascillato/esp-knx-ip). The original is [here](https://github.com/envy/esp-knx-ip).

**Esp8266 board libraries:**
* v2.6.3 Works fine. No known issues. **(RECOMMENDED)**.
* v2.6.2 Works fine. No known issues. Bigger flash usage than 2.6.1.
* v2.6.1 Works fine. No known issues. Smaller flash usage than 2.6.0 
* v2.6.0 Works fine. No known issues.
* v2.5.2 Has some wifi issues. Sleep feature works fine but needs to be 0 for better KNX performance. Do not use.
* v2.5.1 Has some wifi and **security** issues. Do not use.
* v2.5.0 Has some wifi and **security** issues. Do not use.
* v2.4.2 Command sleep don't work in this version. It has **security** issues. Do not use.
* v2.4.1 Have some wifi and **security** issues. Do not use.
* v2.4.0 Have some wifi and **security** issues. Do not use.
* v2.3.0 It is slower than v2.4.2. Sleep feature works but it has **security** issues. Do not use.

## Firmware ##

In the [releases](https://github.com/ascillato/Tasmota_KNX/releases) section you can download the precompiled binaries for flashing ESP8266, ESP8285 and ESP32 devices.
If you want the the precompiled binaries from the development branch, you can find them in the [Build_Output](https://github.com/ascillato/Tasmota_KNX/tree/development/build_output/firmware)
If you need any other feature enabled or disabled, or a different Arduino core, you can use [TasmoCompiler](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/benzino77/tasmocompiler) ([readme](https://github.com/benzino77/tasmocompiler)) or you can modify the **my_user_config.h** file and build your firmware as explained in the [docs](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/#/).

## Implemented Features ##

The implemented features (up to now) in KNX for Tasmota are:

General:
* Buttons (just push)
* Relays (on/off/toggle)
* Lights (led strips, etc. but just on/off)

Sensor lists that you can use in KNX is (only one sensor per type):
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Energy (v, i, power)

Features that can be used with Tasmota's rules:
* Send KNX command (on/off)
* Receive KNX command (on/off)
* Send values by KNX (any float type, temperature for example)
* Receive values by KNX (any float type, temperature for example)
* Receive a KNX read request
* View/Set the Physical Address
* View/Set Group Address to send data
* View/Set Group Address to receive data

## Usage Examples ##

There are multiple possible configurations. Here are explained just a few as example. The options for selecting relays, buttons, sensors, etc. are only available if were configured on _Configure Module Menu_.

To configure KNX, enter on the Configuration Menu of Tasmota and select Configure KNX.

<img src="https://github.com/ascillato/Tasmota_KNX/blob/development/.github/Config_Menu.jpg" />
<img src="https://github.com/ascillato/Tasmota_KNX/blob/development/.github/KNX_menu.jpg" />

_Note on KNX communication enhancement option: As Wifi Multicast communication is not reliable in some wifi router due to IGMP problems or Snooping, an enhancement was implemented. This option increase the reliability by reducing the chances of losing telegrams, sending the same telegram 3 times. In practice it works really good and it is enough for normal home use. When this option is on, Tasmota will ignore toggle commands by KNX if those are sent more than 1 toggle per second. Just 1 toggle per second is working fine._

**1) Setting Several Tasmotas to be controlled as one by a Home Automation System:**

We can set one of the group address to be the same in all the devices so as to turn them on or off at the same time.
In this case, so as to inform the status of all the relays to the Automation System, just one of the devices have to be configured as the responder. If you use the same Group Address for sending and receiving, you have to take into account not to make loops.

DEVICE 2

<img src="https://github.com/ascillato/Tasmota_KNX/blob/development/.github/2.jpg" />

**2) Setting 2 Tasmotas to be linked as stair lights:**

We can set one device to send the status of its output and another to read that and follow. And the second device can send the status of its button and the first device will toggle. With this configuration we can avoid to make a loop.

DEVICE 2

<img src="https://github.com/ascillato/Tasmota_KNX/blob/development/.github/4.jpg" />

**3) Setting a button as initiator of a scene:**

Just setting one device to send the push of a button, and the rest just use that value to turn them on. In this case, there is no toggle. Every time the button is pushed, the turn on command is sent.

DEVICE 2

<img src="https://github.com/ascillato/Tasmota_KNX/blob/development/.github/6.jpg" />

**4) Setting a Temperature sensor:**

We can configure to send the value of temperature or humidity every teleperiod. This teleperiod can be configured. See Tasmota [wiki](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/wiki/Commands). It is recommended also to set the reply temperature address.

<img src="https://github.com/ascillato/Tasmota_KNX/blob/development/.github/7.jpg" />

**5) Using rules:**

More functionality can be added to Tasmota using rules.

* In the KNX Menu, can be set a Group Address to send data or commands by rules, as **KNX TX1** to **KNX TX5**

In rules we can use the command ``KnxTx_Cmnd1 1`` to send an ON state command to the group address set in **KNX TX1** slot of the KNX menu.
Also, we can use the command ``KnxTx_Val1 15`` to send a 15 value to the group address set in **KNX TX1** slot of the KNX menu.

* In the KNX Menu can be set a Group Address to receive commands by rules as **KNX RX1** to **KNX RX5**

In rules we can use the events to catch the reception of COMMANDS from KNX to those RX Slots.

Example: ``rule on event#knxrx_cmnd1 do var1 %value% endon`` to store the command received in the variable VAR1

In rules we can use the events to catch the reception of VALUES from KNX to those RX Slots.

Example: ``rule on event#knxrx_val1 do var1 %value% endon`` to store the value received in the variable VAR1

Also, if a Read request is received from KNX Network, we can use that in a rule as for example: ``rule on event#knxrx_req1 do knxtx_val1 %var3% endon``

[![Download Dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/download-development-yellow.svg)](http://thehackbox.org/tasmota/)
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/arendst/Tasmota.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/arendst/Tasmota)

See [tasmota/CHANGELOG.md](tasmota/CHANGELOG.md) for detailed change information.

Unless your Tasmota powered device exhibits a problem or you need to make use of a feature that is not available in the Tasmota version currently installed on your device, leave your device alone - it works so don't make unnecessary changes! If the release version (i.e., the master branch) exhibits unexpected behaviour for your device and configuration, you should upgrade to the latest development version instead to see if your problem is resolved as some bugs in previous releases or development builds may already have been resolved.

The Tasmota development codebase is checked every 1-2 hours for changes. If new commits have been merged and they compile successfuly, new binary files for every variant will be posted at http://thehackbox.org/tasmota/ (this web address can be used for OTA updates too). The last compiled commit number is also indicated on the same page. It is important to note that these binaries are based on the current development codebase. These commits are tested as much as is possible and are typically quite stable. However, it is infeasible to test on the hundreds of different types of devices with all the available configuration options permitted.

Note that there is a chance, as with any upgrade, that the device may not function as expected. You must always account for the possibility that you may need to flash the device via the serial programming interface if the OTA upgrade fails. Even with the master release, you should always attempt to test the device or a similar prototype before upgrading a device which is in production or is hard to reach. And, as always, make a backup of the device configuration before beginning any firmware update.

## Disclaimer

:warning: **DANGER OF ELECTROCUTION** :warning:

If your device connects to mains electricity (AC power) there is danger of electrocution if not installed properly. If you don't know how to install it, please call an electrician (***Beware:*** certain countries prohibit installation without a licensed electrician present). Remember: _**SAFETY FIRST**_. It is not worth the risk to yourself, your family and your home if you don't know exactly what you are doing. Never tinker or try to flash a device using the serial programming interface while it is connected to MAINS ELECTRICITY (AC power).

We don't take any responsibility nor liability for using this software nor for the installation or any tips, advice, videos, etc. given by any member of this site or any related site.

## Note

Please do not ask to add new devices unless it requires additional code for new features. If the device is not listed as a module, try using [Templates](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Templates) first. If it is not listed in the [Tasmota Device Templates Repository](http://blakadder.github.io/templates) create your own [Template](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Templates#creating-your-template).

## Quick Install
Download one of the released binaries from https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/releases and flash it to your hardware [using our installation guide](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Getting-Started).

## Important User Compilation Information
If you want to compile Tasmota yourself keep in mind the following:

- Only Flash Mode **DOUT** is supported. Do not use Flash Mode DIO / QIO / QOUT as it might seem to brick your device.
- Tasmota uses a 1M linker script WITHOUT spiffs **1M (no SPIFFS)** for optimal code space.
- To make compile time changes to Tasmota use the `user_config_override.h` file. It assures keeping your custom settings when you download and compile a new version. You have to make a copy from the provided `user_config_override_sample.h` file and add your setting overrides. To enable the override you have to set a compile define as documented in the `user_config_override_sample.h` file.

## Configuration Information

Please refer to the installation and configuration articles in our [documentation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs).
